<p>🎮 The Impossible Game Design Challenge 🎲</p>
<p>Can we create a multiplayer game where time doesn't matter?</p>
<p>We're looking for innovative game designers to tackle an "impossible" challenge: designing a multiplayer board game with an unprecedented save/load mechanism that defies the conventional limits of time and player presence.</p>
<p>The Core Challenge:
Create a game where:
- A player can leave mid-game, save their progress, and return days later
- Other players continue playing normally in their absence
- Upon return, the departed player resumes exactly where they left off
- The returning player experiences the game as if no time has passed
- The game maintains perfect consistency for all players</p>
<p>Key Design Constraints:
1. The game must be deterministic yet feel dynamic
2. Player decisions must be meaningful but not create temporal paradoxes
3. The mechanism should be seamless and natural, not feeling like a "patch"</p>
<p>Theoretical Considerations:
- How do we handle information revelation?
- Can we create meaningful player interaction across different timeframes?
- What mechanics would allow for both autonomy and interconnected gameplay?</p>
<p>Think of it as designing a game that treats time as a game resource rather than a limitation. Like playing chess where one player exists in Monday while another plays on Friday, yet the game remains coherent.</p>
<p>Are you up for this seemingly impossible challenge? Share your design concepts, no matter how wild or experimental they might seem!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!info]
Note: This is a theoretical exercise that pushes the boundaries of game design thinking. While a perfect solution might not exist, the journey of exploring this problem could lead to fascinating new game mechanics.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>The game result $Y$ is a function of $\Sigma = {\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_n}$, the actions taken by all $n$ players.</p>
<p>Where each $\sigma_i$ is a sequence of actions $\sigma_i^{(1)}, \sigma_i^{(2)}, \ldots$</p>
<p><strong>Simple Case:</strong>
For player 1, he's agnostic of all other players' actions in the game.</p>
<p>Example: mine sweeping (the only interaction is the final score comparison)</p>
<p><strong>direction 1</strong>
<strong>extrapolation</strong> for player 1's behavior after his absence.</p>
<p><strong>direction 2</strong>
let game saving be part of the game mechanism</p>
<hr />
<h1>Solution 1: Predicate Game</h1>
<p>Two players choose a "proposition" at the beginning of the game.</p>
<p>Then the game is launched.</p>
<p>One want to hold the proposition true, another wants to hold the negative proposition true.</p>
<p>In each one's perspective, himself plays as $\exists$ , while the other plays as $\forall$ .</p>
<p>When one player quits, the game "diverges" with each player's opponent replaced by an "optimal" bot.</p>
<p>The "bot" is only an imagined entity (for illustrative purpose) but what actually carried out is:</p>
<p>For both players now, if a "proof" of his version(positive or not) of the proposition doesn't exist, he automatically loses the game. Otherwise, he needs to provide a proof for the proposition. He wins the game if the proof passes the check.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Consider the proposition "For any positive integer n, there exists m where m&gt;n."</p>
<p>Player 1 wants to prove this true, while Player 2 wants to prove it false.</p>
<p>If Player 1/2 leaves, the game diverges into two scenarios:
For Player 1: They need to give a proof that such m exists.
For Player 2: Automatically loses the game.</p>
